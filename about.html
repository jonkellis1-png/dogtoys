        <section class="about-me">
            <p>Hello! My name is <strong>Jonathan Kellis</strong>. I'm 13 years old and currently attend <strong>Dexter Southfield School</strong>. 
            <p>Recently, I adopted a puppy named <strong>Pooka</strong> who is only 2 months old. Spending time with Pooka inspired me to start this project: a small online shop where dog owners can buy fun and safe toys for their furry friends.</p>
            <p>My goal is to make dogs happy with high-quality toys, including TPU bones, fish-shaped chew toys, and customizable PLA dog bowls. If you'd like to purchase any of these, please contact me at <strong>857 *** 1983</strong> or <strong>30kellijo@dextersouthfield.org</strong>.</p>
